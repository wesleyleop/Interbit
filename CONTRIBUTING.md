If you would like to know more about how it works head over to our [SDK Documentation](https://docs.interbit.io/).

Please do not open issues just to ask a question. We are happy to help and are available for questions and comments on other channels.


## Opening an Issue

A good issue is one that
- is clear
- describes its own closing criteria
- contains a description that explains what the issue is
- has a description of how to reproduce the bug if it is for a bug
- is labelled appropriately

When you open an issue please use a descriptive title that has a clear goal and closing criteria.

For example: "link on accounts does nothing" is not a good title because it doesn't describe a task that can be completed but "Fix broken link on accounts" does.

In the description box, describe the issue in more detail. If you know approximately what needs to be done to fix it or several related things that need to be fixed along with it make a checklist of todo items.

For our example ticket you could specify which link is broken.

## Opening a PR

A good PR is one that
- contains tests for its features
- has a descriptive title
- has even more description in the description box
- links to any issues it closes or references
- has a list of items and changes that were made in the PR
