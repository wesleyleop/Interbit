Skilled blockchain developers are expensive and hard to find. The current open-source and public blockchains require a significant investment of time to learn, digest, and practice before meaningful application development can take place. This often includes learning new languages and tools that most developers have little to no experience with.

Interbit was designed to expose the power and benefits of blockchain technology to application developers via some of today’s most familiar, popular and proven languages, tools and design patterns.`,

Unlike the monolithic public blockchains that slow down (the time to reach consensus, validate transactions and create a new block) as the # of transactions increases, Interbit's chain joining capabilities allow developers to scale simply by adding more chains. Additionally, developers can create chains that are optimized for specific functions and join those to create many chain application architectures. Interbit's chain joining capability is a viable way to meet the speed and scale enterprises demand.`

For many businesses this is simply an unacceptable situation (even if the data is encrypted) given the risk of inadvertent sharing of sensitive data (sometimes called metadata leakage) raises competitive concerns among parties on the same chain.

Interbit’s unique abilities to create chains, selectively join them into a many chain architecture, *and* have granular control over what data is shared between them results in true privacy through data segregation and eliminates the possibility of metadata leakage. True privacy, in your control.

This mixture of securely connected chains can address a wide range of competitive, legal and regulatory challenges, enabling a large network of collaborative and competitive organizations to all selectively share the required data to operate effectively with the appropriate degree of transparency.`
